# Ruby Glossary


## IRB

Stands for interactive ruby. This is a shell you can call from your command line 

## Comparator

A comparator is an operator which compares two values, so in the expression 3 > 0, the comparator is ‘>’, and the statement is asking ‘Is 3 greater than 0’. If you put this into the IRB terminal, you would of course receive the answer ‘true’
A further list of comparison operators (and other ruby operators) can be found here

## String
A datatype that is best thought of as a line of text. String always have to be within matching quote marks, for example; "this is a string", 'this is also a string'.

## Integer
A datatype that is a whole number, 12 is an example of a integer, whilst "12" is a string. 12.5 is not a whole number so I cannot be an integer, we describe this as a float, due to the floating point.

## Boolean

A boolean refers to a value that is either ‘true’ or ‘false’. Every appearance, or instance, of true in a Ruby program is an instance of TrueClass , while every appearance of false is an instance of FalseClass

## Array

An Array is a data structure that represents a list of elements, such as 
[1,2,3] or [“one element”, “another element”]. Arrays let you store multiple values in a single variable. This can condense and organize your code, making it more readable and maintainable. Arrays are very useful for containing, transorming and manipulating data in applications.


## Ruby Gem

A ruby gem is an add on, a small program written in ruby which is do specific thing.

## Method

Sometimes called a function in other languages, a method in Ruby is a set of expressions that returns a value. With methods, one can organize their code into subroutines that can be easily invoked from other areas of their program. Methods are the building blocks to developing your own program


## Param/ parameter

A param, or parameter, is an object (such as a string or a number) that is passed to a method.
