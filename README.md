# Intro to Ruby!

Hello and welcome to a little introduction to Ruby.

The notes for the class can be found in the [course_notes]('./course_notes.md') page. We will work through these in the session

I've put a simple [glossary here]('./glossary.md') which includes some of the basic we will be covering in this session.

Finally, the last excercise we will do in the lesson can be found in the `bowling.rb` file. In order to run this, please run `bundle install` from the root directory of this file, from your terminals. Thiss should install rspec.
